#### Abstract

Oceanic oil spill pollution poses a serious threat to marine ecosystems.
Undetected spills from accidents or operational discharges from ships can harm
marine life residing on the sea surface or on shore. Previous studies try to
automatically detect spills using remote sensing imagery from synthetic aperture
radars. However, the accuracy of the traditional algorithms is limited by the
presence of look-alike biogenic films that have overlapping physical features with
true oil spills. Difficulties remain in identifying useful features and their
combinations to distinguish between the two categories. Here, we proposed a
methodology based on a genetic algorithm to address this challenge. This procedure
finds an optimal or near-optimal solution within a given search space by mimicking
the natural processes of competition, reproduction, mutation etc. Our procedure
also addresses the premature convergence problem commonly found in genetic
algorithms. We tested the procedure on simulated datasets using published statistics,
and our results show an average accuracy of 88.2% for oil spills, representing a
statistically significant improvement over the literature (~82%). The optimized
classification also reduces the time spent on look-alikes, allowing for a faster
response to minimize environmental damage.

        It's hard for the human eye to distinguish oil spills and lookalikes films in
        the water from satellite radar imagery. Ideally, an autonomous system would be
        able to accurately flag oil spills and send coastal cleanup crews.

#### Method

My paper introduced a method called *Adaptive Chromosome Replacement*, which is a form of an exploration
bonus for a genetic algorithm. It accomplishes this by randomly injecting noise into generations, when
the overall population and gene pool have become too stagnant.

```python
def cross(self, generation, male, female) :
    locuses = random.sample(range(0, male.length() - 1), 2)
    locus_left = min(locuses)
    locus_right = max(locuses)

    child_1 = deepcopy(male)
    child_2 = deepcopy(female)

    # Adaptive Chromosome Replacement (ACR)
    if child_1.fitness == child_2.fitness:
        if generation < int(self.NUMBER_OF_GENS / 3):
            child_1 = Chromosome(Trainer.n_features)
            child_2 = Chromosome(Trainer.n_features)
        elif generation < int(2 * self.NUMBER_OF_GENS / 3):
            child_2 = Chromosome(Trainer.n_features)
        else:
            child_2 = self.random_chromosome()

    child_1.replace_range(female, locus_left, locus_right)
    child_2.replace_range(male, locus_left, locus_right)

    return [child_1, child_2]
```
