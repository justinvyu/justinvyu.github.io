This was a project submission to the <a href="https://m3challenge.siam.org/archives/2018">2018 MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge</a>, which is a 14-hour national contest where we were asked to present a mathematical
solution to the following prompt:

<blockquote>
BETTER ATE THAN NEVER: REDUCING FOOD WASTE:
This problem asked participants to quantify the costs and benefits of repurposing squandered food, and to recommend strategies for communities to adopt.
</blockquote>

My team and I were selected as finalists, and we went to Jane Street NYC HQ to present. We ended
up taking home first place! The paper we submitted was published in the SIAM Undergraduate Research
Journal as <a href="https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Volume%2011/M3PDF2018.pdf?ver=2018-09-20-160914-513"><i>A Mathematical Analysis of Food Waste Production and Redistribution</i></a>.

        <p class="card-text">
        It's hard for the human eye to distinguish oil spills and lookalikes films in
        the water from satellite radar imagery. Ideally, an autonomous system would be
        able to accurately flag oil spills and send coastal cleanup crews.
