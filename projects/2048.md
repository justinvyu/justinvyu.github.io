#### Summary

I recreated the game 2048 for my AP Computer Science class in 11th grade. I had a lot of fun
making the UI as similar to the original as possible (I even got the same font)!

This project was a really big challenge for me at the time. It was one of the first projects
where I had complete control over my codebase, and I really felt the complexity of the
application grow as time went on. Every design decision that I made in the beginning
really mattered as I added more and more logic. It was a great exercise in handling this
complexity using abstraction and object oriented programming.
