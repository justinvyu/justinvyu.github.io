## Hi, my name is Justin! 👋

I'm currently a sophomore (class of 2022) studying Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at UC Berkeley 🐻!

I've lived in the Bay Area my whole life

Some things I enjoy:

* Drinking coffee, pretending to be productive, while listening to lofi beats™️
* Configuring my [vim/tmux setup](https://github.com/justinvyu/dotfiles)
* Satisfying math proofs 🤓
* Playing with my dog [Yoda]({{site.baseurl}}/public/assets/yoda.jpg)

Current Goals:
* Get a job this summer
* Do one of the side projects that I've been putting off for a while
* Make some music...
